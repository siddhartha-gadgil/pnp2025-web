The assignment is in the course repository file [TreeMem.lean](https://github.com/proofs-and-programs/proofs-and-programs-25/blob/main/PfsProgs25/Labs/TreeMem.lean). The easiest way to work on the assignment is to open the link in [Lean 4 Web Editor](https://live.lean-lang.org/#url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proofs-and-programs/proofs-and-programs-25/refs/heads/main/PfsProgs25/Labs/TreeMem.lean). You can edit the file, copy its contents and submit.

Alternatively, you can fork the repository and work on the assignment in your local Lean 4 installation.

##### Submission

To submit, please send a direct message to me on the **course** Zulip server, with your solution enclosed in a [code block](https://zulip.com/help/code-blocks), with the language left blank (`Lean 4` is the default language).
