1. Let `$X$` be a topological space and `$x_0$` be a point in `$X$`. Let `$Z$` be the path-component of `$x_0$` in `$X$`. Show that the inclusion `$i: Z \hookrightarrow X$` induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups.

2. Let `$f: (X, x_0)\to (Y, y_0)$` be a map between based topological spaces and
let `$f_*: \pi_1(X, x_0)\to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$` be the induced map on fundamental groups.
Prove or disprove the following statements:
    * __(a)__ If `$f$` is injective then so is `$f_*$`.
    * __(b)__ If `$f$` is surjective then so is `$f_*$`.
    * __(c)__ If `$f$` is a homeomorphism then `$f_*$` is an isomorphism.
