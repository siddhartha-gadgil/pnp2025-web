#### Projects

A core component of the course is the project. This can be done individually or in groups. However, while a project is "owned" by a group or individual, collaborative live-coding will be done in lectures on projects with everyone contributing. Indeed, many concepts will be explained and illustrates through code relevant to the projects.

The projects will be Lean code which can be either implementations of algorithms with proofs in Lean or formalizations of mathematical results in Lean.  There is considerable flexibility in the choice of projects. However, the topic of the project must be chosen to be useful to the Lean ecosystem, so should avoid dulicating existing code. Further, all code must be properly documented. To help choose, I have compiled some [suggested projects](./projects/index.html).

When starting the project, the goal should be clearly stated after discussion with the course instructor. In case a project is ambitious, an intermediate step can be defined as the target goal with a stretch goal going beyond this. Failing to meet the target will mean a reduction in grade, as will incomplete or unclear documentation.

#### Grading

Course grades will be based on labs, a midterm examination, and the final project. The weights are as follows:

* __Lab assignments:__ 20%; these will be regularly assigned.
* __Midterm Examination:__ 30%.
* __Final Project:__ 50%; this will be due on the date of the final examination.


##### Setting up Lean 4 and Repository

For details on setting up Lean 4 and repositories for assignments and projects, see the [Lean setup instructions](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

##### Zulip chat

As with Lean we will use a [Zulip server](https://automathind.zulipchat.com/login/) for discussions. You can  also post on the stream by sending an email to the [channel address](mailto:proofs-and-programs-2025.cfda7aa3ebaafd84b15154b5266978db.show-sender@streams.zulipchat.com).
