##### Microsoft Teams details

A Team for this course (within IISc) named __Introduction to Algebraic Topology 2023__ has been created. Anyone from IISc can also join using the Team code `u1hkivl`. Assignments will be submitted through Teams. 

There are Teams apps available for Windows, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat), Mac, Android and iOS. I would encourage using the Teams chat to ask questions whenever needed.  

##### Assignment submissions

Assignments will be posted on this web site and linked in Microsoft Teams. They have to be submitted through Microsoft Teams. The ea
siest way to do this is to write on paper, photograph or scan this and submit `pdf` or image files. It is recommended that you use a
n app like `Adobe scan` or `Microsoft Lens` to generate a single pdf file for each assignment (instead of a collection of images).

If you wish you can instead use `LaTeX` and submit `pdf` files.


##### Additional Resources

This course was [taught online](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/introduction-algebraic-topology-2020/index.html) in 2021. The [lectures](https://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/introduction-algebraic-topology-2020/all-lectures/) are online.

Note that students are responsible for all the material covered in the lectures this semester, which is likely to be more than that in the above resources. Experience also suggests that offline lectures are more effective. Thus, it is wise to use the above as supplements, not substitutes, for the lectures.
