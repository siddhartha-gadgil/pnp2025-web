This course is an introduction to *interactive theorem proving* using the proof assistant [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). Interactive theorem proving can be used to formalize mathematics and to verify the correctness of programs. We will discuss both aspects of the course, as well as *foundations* of mathematics and computer science that are relevant to these topics.

More details are forthcoming.
